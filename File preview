Preview  for the BMI Calculator Code
This BMI Calculator is a simple web-based tool designed to help users calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) and understand their health category. Below is the description of the functionality and layout of the code provided:

Layout and Features
Title and Header:

The webpage has a centered title, "BMI Calculator," at the top.
Input Fields:

Two input fields are present:
Weight (kg): Users can input their weight in kilograms.
Height (m): Users can input their height in meters (decimal values are supported).
Submit Button:

A green button labeled "Calculate BMI" calculates the BMI when clicked.
Result Display:

The calculated BMI and the health category (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obesity) are displayed below the form.
Functionality
Input Validation:

Ensures that both weight and height are positive numbers before performing the calculation.
BMI Calculation:

Uses the formula:
BMI= weight/(height * height)
 
Categorization:

Categorizes the user's BMI into one of four standard categories:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
Obesity: BMI ≥ 30

Dynamic Feedback:

Results are dynamically shown below the form without refreshing the page.
Styling
The code uses CSS for basic styling:
Clean and simple design.
Center-aligned form and results for better readability.
A green button that changes to a darker shade when hovered over.

How It Works
Users enter their weight and height into the form.
Clicking the "Calculate BMI" button runs a JavaScript function that:
Retrieves the input values.
Validates the inputs to ensure they are positive.
Calculates the BMI and determines the corresponding category.
Displays the result dynamically on the page.
Visual Preview
If implemented, the webpage would look like this:
